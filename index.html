<blockquote>
<p>Kafka Summit SF - Oct 16-17th 2018</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t you love signing in to your favorite application only to discover it’s undergoing scheduled maintenance? I know I don’t! 
Designing scalable systems is a challenge all software engineers face. Ultimately this means you will find yourself in a situation
where you need to upgrade your software engines for better performance. In this session, I will guide you through the experience of swapping out PagerDuty’s original prop engine consisting of a Cassandra
queue-based system to that of a 747 which utilizes Kafka not only for ingestion of customer data but also internal heuristics and
back pressure support.</p>
